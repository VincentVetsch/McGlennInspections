McGlennInspections

   The McGlenn Home Inspections, LLC website shall be a Django Application with
   a clean look and feel.  The reason behind using Django is it’s scalablility
   and speed.  Some of the application will be static in nature, such as the
   index page, contact information, and links(I will revisit this if links.html
   becomes unmanagable).

The site needs to be completed by 01APR13
