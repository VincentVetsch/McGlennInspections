McGlennInspections

The McGlenn Home Inspections, LLC website shall be a Django Application with a
clean look and feel.  The reason behind using Django is it’s scalablility and
speed.  Some of the application will be static in nature, such as the index
page, contact information, and links(I will revisit this if links.html becomes
unmanagable).

The site needs to be completed by 01APR13

Tasks:
   • TODO — Clean up slug field in terms
   • TODO — Clean up jquery libraries
   • TODO — Create base.html for the project
   • TODO — Complete all views
      ◦ TODO — Complete slideshow view
      ◦ TODO — Complete appointment view
      ◦ TODO — Complete blog view
      ◦ TODO — Complete glossary view
      ◦ TODO — Complete rvalues view
   • TODO — Google or Yahoo Calendar to site.  This will allow customers to see
   our current schedule and workload.

      ◦ DONE — Create models
      ◦ DONE — Create admin
   • DONE — Add all templates to the applications
   • DONE — Added Terms.csv to database.  May need to reformat files
   • DONE — Run syncdb on McGlennInspections.  I want to make sure that the tables are correct before I run syncdb.  Not that it is that big of deal, tables can be dropped and recreated.

Ideas:
   • Create a report application, where the Appointment application creates a
   template for a checklist and the final report.
   • Create a friendly way to allow the customer to get a copy of a final
   report from the website.
