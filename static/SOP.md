#1. Definitions and Scope
##1.1. General Home Inspection
A general home inspection is a non-invasive, visual examination of the accessible areas of a residential property (as delineated below), performed for a fee, which is designed to identify defects within specific systems and components defined by these Standards that are both observed and deemed material by the inspector.  The scope of work may be modified by the Client and Inspector prior to the inspection process.

The general home inspection is based on the observations made on the date of the inspection, and not a prediction of future conditions.

The general home inspection will not reveal every issue that exists or ever could exist, but only those material defects observed on the date of the inspection.

##1.2. Material Defects
A material defect is a specific issue with a system or component of a residential property that may have a significant, adverse impact on the value of the property, or that poses an unreasonable risk to people.  The fact that a system or component is near, at or beyond the end of its normal useful life is not, in itself, a material defect.

##1.3. Home Inspection Report
A general home inspection report shall identify, in written format, defects within specific systems and components defined by these Standards that are both observed and deemed material by the inspector.  Inspection reports may include additional comments and recommendations.
