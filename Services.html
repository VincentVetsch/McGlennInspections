        <p>Not everyone knows what goes into building a house, let alone what can happen to that house when it goes on neglected for many years.  Building science is more than pouring concrete, framing, slapping shingles down, throwing some siding on, and painting.  Building science goes past that to see how heat, air(wind), and moisture can affect the concrete, framing, shingles, siding, paint, and even insulation of the house.  McGlenn Home Inspections LLC uses not only the information provided from training and experience, but also the information obtained on building science, to thoroughly inspect the house to give you, the client, the most information possible.  Let's face it, the more information you have, the better decision you can make.</p>
        <p>Not only will McGlenn Home Inspections LLC find the problem areas AND the good areas, but we will also supply you with a fully detailed(with pictures) report with detailed notes and comments.</p>
